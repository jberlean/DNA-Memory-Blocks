# Usage
This analysis code requires a single comma-separated (.csv) or tab-separated (.tsv, .txt) file describing the sample layout on the 384-well plate and the CT values generated by the qPCR machine. This data file should have, at a minimum, the columns "Well", "Well Position", "Target Name", "Sample Name", and "CT". An example data file is given by `qPCR_example_data.csv`.

For example, the following will analyze the example data files:

`$ python analyze_pulldown_qpcr.py qPCR_example_data.csv`

# Customization
This script assumes blank wells have the sample name 'BLANK'. To change this behavior, edit the BLANK_NAMES variable in analyze_pulldown_qpcr.py.
To manually enter the names of the pulls, edit the PULL_NAMES variable. Change PULL_NAMES to None to automatically determine the pull names.
